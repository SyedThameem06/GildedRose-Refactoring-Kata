# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

This Kata is a refactor of Java-Approvals with maven wrapper.

In this Kata I have added the factory design pattern to create Instances.

As per the requirement all scenario of the Items are converted into to an object.

Each and every Class is given with Test Case. Program Class is the entry point.

The complexity of the code is refactored, and everything is independent.

If any other new requirement is required to be added also can be added without considering much about the existing flow.

# To Start the Project.

- mvn clean install

Run the Program class to instantiate the project.

To Run the Test Case instantiate GildedRoseTest, Anyway all test cases will run during mvn clean install.
